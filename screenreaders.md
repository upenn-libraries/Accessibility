# All About Screen Readers

## Software recommendations
| Name | Operating System | Price | Details |
|:--------------:|:----------------:|-------------|-----------|
| VoiceOver (VO) | Mac | Free, native to Mac. | Requires no installation and comes with a built-in tutorial. A beginner-friendly, low-barrier screen reader if you have a Mac. |
| NVDA | Windows | Free, open-source. | Must be downloaded and installed from the [NVDA website](https://www.nvaccess.org/download/).  |
| JAWS | Windows | Not Free. | You (or your organization) must purchase a license in order to use JAWS, even for testing purposes. JAWS is more popular, but it'll cost ya. |

## How many screen readers should I test with?
[WebAIM's Screenreader Q&A](https://webaim.org/articles/screenreader_testing/) contains an in-depth discussion of this issue, but in short: *Consistently* testing with one or two popular screen readers should generally be enough. Testing with both VoiceOver and a Windows screen reader (either JAWS or NVDA) is an excellent goal. Since all screen readers differ, more is always nice, but the more important thing is to make sure your website adheres to standard guidelines & accessible design practices.

**Consistent, recurrent testing with *one* screen reader is vastly superior to inconsistent, sporadic testing in multiple screen readers.**

## How to start using VoiceOver
On your Mac, go to System Preferences > Accessibility > VoiceOver. There, you can enable VoiceOver. (You can also hit Command + F5 to toggle VO on and off.)
When you first enable VO, it will give you the option to use its tutorial. The tutorial is a great way to walk through the basics.

Penn State has a handy developer-oriented cheatsheet of VO commands: http://accessibility.psu.edu/screenreaders/voiceover/

WebAIM also has a useful introduction to testing with VO: https://webaim.org/articles/voiceover/
