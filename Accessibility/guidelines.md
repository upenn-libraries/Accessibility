# Guidelines for Making Applications Accessible

## Level 1: What must be done
This level is defined as measures that are required for an application to be considered accessible. 

## Level 2: What should also be done
This level is defined as measures, on top of those taken in Level 1, that should be done to make an application accessible beyond baseline measures.

## Level 3: What may be done
This level is defined as measures that may be taken to enhance accessibility of an application, but that are not a requirement for the application to be accessible.
