| ![Alt text missing](images/alt_missing.png) | An image without an alt attribute is present. | Add an appropriate value to the alt attribute for this image.  If it is purely decorative, consider moving it into the CSS for the page. | [Best practices for alt text creation (including code examples)](../../code_examples/alt_text.md) |
| ![Form label missing](images/label_missing.png) | A form field without an accessible label is present. | Add a form label with appropriate descriptive text associated with the form field, using the "for" attribute on the label and the "id" attribute on the form field. | [Code example](../../code_examples/form_label.md) |
| ![Suspicious alt text](images/alt_suspicious.png) | Suspicious alt text | The alt text of the image appears to be incorrect, insufficient, or otherwise unhelpful. | An image has an alt text attribute, but it contains values that indicate that it is suspicious.  This may because the alt text is too short, too long, contains obviously-suspicious values such as ```alt="."```, or otherwise does not follow alt text best practices recommendations. | [Best practices for alt text creation (including code examples)](../../code_examples/alt_text.md) |
