# Incident Response

We all know the Internet is broken. There will always be bugs that someone can exploit.
Rather than waiting for an emergency to happen and deciding how to respond in the throes of chaos and uncertainty, we should plan ahead so that when the day comes that the unexpected happens, we can respond in a collected, constructive manner.
Bad things **do** happen to good people; better to be prepared than be in denial when it happens.

## TO-DO: Create a checklist to follow when something happens. Things to consider:
### 1. Initiate
* Who to contact? What are the proper channels for neutralizing a potential incident quickly and effectively?
* What are the roles and responsibilities during an incident?
* How will incidents be tracked through their lifetime?

### 2. Communicate
* What are the steps to take to mitigate issues and make sure all bases are covered?
* Will there be updates during an ongoing situation? Where? To whom? How often?

### 3. Assess
* Where do we collect information?
* How do we determine severity of an incident?

### 4. Remediate
* Given the incident's severity, what is our response SLA?
* How do we prioritize remediation, both short and long-term?
* How do we communicate and track remediation?
* What kind of public response should be formulated? To what scope were patrons affected?

### 5. Retrospective
* How do we explore causes?
* What metrics do we need to collect?
* How will we track long-term follow-up?
