# Data Retention

* What patron data are we keeping?
* Where are we keeping it?
* For how long?
* Why? What do we do with this data?
* Who can access this data?
* Are we using all the data we keep?
* How secure is this data? Is it/can it be encrypted?
* Are patrons aware of the data we collect? Are there ways for them to opt-out?
* How often should we revisit this topic?

### Google Analytics:
* Does the information we collect and track in GA fit into this conversation?
* **GA Alternatives** (Open-source & locally hosted):
    * [Piwik](https://piwik.org/) - Alternative to [Google Analytics](https://analytics.google.com/).
    * [7tag](https://7tag.org/) - Alternative to [Google Tag Manager](https://www.google.com/analytics/tag-manager/).
        * If we move away from GA, the Web Unit is highly interested in securing an alternative for GTM, if feasible. A tag manager cuts down on maintenance time and provides the ability to introduce significant analytics changes without changing our code.
