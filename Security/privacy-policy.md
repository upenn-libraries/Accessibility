# Penn Libraries Privacy Policy

[https://www.library.upenn.edu/policies/privacy.html](https://www.library.upenn.edu/policies/privacy.html)
Don't be fooled by the 2015 "Last update" stamp; that wasn't an actual content update. The policies themselves have not been updated in many years.

We should make sure this policy is up-to-date, and add anything that might be missing.
Also, are there ways the policy's langage can be clarified and made more specific and understandable?
