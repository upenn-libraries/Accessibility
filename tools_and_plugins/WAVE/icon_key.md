| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| ![Alt text missing](images/alt_missing.png) | An image without an alt attribute is present. | Add an appropriate value to the alt attribute for this image.  If it is purely decorative, consider moving it into the CSS for the page. | [Best practices for alt text creation](../../code_examples/alt_text.md) |
| ![Form label missing](images/label_missing.png) | A form field without an accessible label is present. | Add a form label with appropriate descriptive text associated with the form field, using the "for" attribute on the label and the "id" attribute on the form field. | [Code example for form labels](../../code_examples/form_label.md) |
| ![Suspicious alt text](images/alt_suspicious.png) | Suspicious alt text | The alt text of the image appears to be incorrect, insufficient, or otherwise unhelpful.  This may because the alt text is too short, too long, or contains obviously-suspicious values such as ```alt="."```.  Consult the best practices guide linked at right for creating alt text. | [Best practices for alt text creation (including code examples)](../../code_examples/alt_text.md) |
| ![Suspicious link text](images/link_suspicious.png) | Suspicious link text | The text value of a link contains suspicious values.  Link text should not be too short, too long, or consist only of non-descriptive phrases such as "click here," "learn more" or "click here to learn more." | [Best practices for HTML links](../../code_examples/links.md)|
| ![PDF linked](images/link_pdf.png) | A PDF document linked directly as an HTML link. | This should be fine as long as the fact that the link target is a PDF is indicated through the text of the link and/or title attribute.  Ideally, an appropriate icon should be used to indicate what type of document is linked as well. | [Best practices for HTML links](../../code_examples/links.md) |
| ![Empty link](images/link_empty.png) | An empty link (```<a href="#"></a>```) has been detected. | Empty links are often accidentally created when using a WYSIWYG editor for content creation.  Empty links are not in compliance with accessibility standards and must be removed. | |
| ![Document language missing](images/language_missing.png)| The default human language(s) of the document are not specified in the HTML header. | Specify the human language(s) contained within the text contents of the document in the HTML header.  See code example at right. | [Code example for language specification](../../code_examples/language.md) |
| ![Noscript element](images/noscript.png) | Noscript element detected | A ```<noscript>``` element has been detected on the page.  This is intended for use in the event that Javascript has been disabled in the user's browser.  This warning is generated because noscript elements are no longer considered a viable option for presenting accessible alternatives of inaccessible scripted content, as nearly allnow have Javascript enabled.  Whatever content is presented in the noscript element must be regarded as seen by very few users, but must also be accessible. | |
