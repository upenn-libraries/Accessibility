# Documentation

This is a listing of ongoing documentation efforts.

## Workflow documentation efforts
* [Metridoc internal documentation (wiki approach)](https://gitlab.library.upenn.edu/metridoc/metridoc-documentation-internal) - Documentation for developing, testing, deploying, and maintaining Metridoc.  The documentation is versioned in the repo but linked from the wiki (indicated in the repo's bare-bones README).
* [Datafarm documentation](https://gitlab.library.upenn.edu/katherly/datafarm-documentation) - Ongoing documentation of Datafarm forms and workflows, updated as needed when undocumented workflows emerge.  Linked directly from application README.
