# Further Reading & Resources

## Books
* "[Don't Make Me Think: A Common Sense Approach to Web Usability](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23941920-don-t-make-me-think)" by Steve Krug
  * A classic in the world of UX. It's a quick, easy read; it contains, as the title suggests, common sense that desperately needs to be applied more than it currently is.
* ["The Design of Everyday Things"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/840.The_Design_of_Everyday_Things) by Donald Norman
  * Another classic. It's not specific to web development, but it applies to our field just as easily as anywhere else. Norman talks about all sorts of everyday things: doors, toasters, control panels/displays, and more. He published this book in 1988, and his ideas still hold up to modern inventions and user interfaces.
* ["100 Things Every Designer Needs to Know About People"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/10778139-100-things-every-designer-needs-to-know-about-people), by Susan. M. Weinschenk
  * Weinschenk has a PhD in Psychologyl; her book contains facts about the human brain, and how these facts translate to designing websites, apps, and software for people. The book is easily digestible and split into logical sections: "How People See", "How People Remember", "How People Decide", etc.
* ["The Elements of User Experience: User-Centered Design for the Web"](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/1867.The_Elements_of_User_Experience) by Jesse James Garrett
  * A quick introductory read; very similar to "Don't Make Me Think", but worth the read even if for no other reason than to make the material really sink in. Multiple perspectives never hurt. The examples are a bit outdated, but the core concepts still apply.
