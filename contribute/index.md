# How to Contribute

You don't have to know how to code to contribute to this effort. You also don't have to write documentation (though you're certainly welcome to). We need help finding out what's missing from this guide and what would be most helpful to *you*.

* Looking for resources about a specific topic, and it's not in our documentation?
* Barely found what you were looking for because navigation was difficult?
* Found a typo or incorrect information?

Otherwise, [submit an issue](https://github.com/upenn-libraries/Accessibility/issues) and we'll make the change for you.
